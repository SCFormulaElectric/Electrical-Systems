The Elcon CAN bus specification is attached.  It complies with CAN 2.0B and J1939 protocols.  1.8KW and 3.3KW chargers use 250Kbps baud rate and 29-bit extended frame CAN ID.  6.6KW chargers use 500Kbps.
 
The charger expects every second to receive a CAN message from the BMS with CAN ID 1806E5F4 and 8 data bytes with voltage and current required.  For example 98V and 16A would be 980 = 03D4 hex and 0160 = 00A0 hex so the 8 data bytes would be 03D4 00A0 0000 0000.  If the charger does not receive a valid CAN message in 5 seconds, it stops charging with a green blinking LED.  It starts charging again when it gets a valid CAN message with a red blinking LED.
 
The charger sends out every second a status message with CAN ID 18FF50E5 with voltage, current and status information.
 
Up to four Elcon PFC chargers can be on the same CAN bus with CAN IDs of E5, E7, E8 and E9.
 
A 120 ohm termination resistor is required between CAN-L and CAN-H.
